/* Collect up the start addresses of all non-free, non-resvn segments.
   The interface is a bit strange in order to avoid potential
   segment-creation races caused by dynamic allocation of the result
   buffer *starts.

   The function first computes how many entries in the result
   buffer *starts will be needed.  If this number <= nStarts,
   they are placed in starts[0..], and the number is returned.
   If nStarts is not large enough, nothing is written to
   starts[0..], and the negation of the size is returned.

   Correct use of this function may mean calling it multiple times in
   order to establish a suitably-sized buffer. */
